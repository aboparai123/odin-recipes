        <h3>Description -</h3>
        <p>If you think of an “Indian snack”, probably the first image that pops into mind is the humble Samosa.
        These little fried parcels of flaky-yet-tender pastry, stuffed to the brim with spiced potatoes and other ingredients, are pretty much my idea of the world’s greatest savoury snack.
        Not only are they insanely delicious, but they’re also incredibly versatile. Samosas can be served as appetizers, entrees, or a lunch on the move. They’re good hot or at room temperature. They keep for days and days, and they reheat well. What is not to love?</p>

        <h3>Steps -</h3>
        <h4>Part 1: Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cube the paneer and soak it in warm water for 10-15 minutes to make it soft. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>If using fresh peas, blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes until they become tender. If using frozen peas, thaw them.</li> 
            <li>Make a smooth paste of the chopped tomatoes in a blender.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h4>Part 2: Sautéing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li> 
            <li>Add chopped onions, ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Sauté until the onions turn golden brown.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h4>Part 3: Tomato Paste and Spices</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and sauté until the oil starts to separate from the tomato mixture. This indicates that the tomatoes are cooked.</li>
            <li>Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h4>Part 4: Add Peas and Paneer</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the green peas and paneer cubes. Stir them into the tomato mixture, making sure they are coated with the spices.</li>
            <li>Add water to achieve your desired gravy consistency. Start with around 1/2 to 1 cup of water, and adjust as needed.</li> 
            <li>Cover the pan and let the peas and paneer simmer in the gravy for about 10-15 minutes or until they are cooked through. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Optionally, you can add fresh cream to make the dish richer and creamier. Stir it in.</li> 
            <li>Sprinkle garam masala over the dish and mix it in. Adjust the seasoning (salt and spices) to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with naan, roti, or rice. Enjoy!</li>
