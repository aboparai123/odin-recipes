        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>If you think of an “Indian snack”, probably the first image that pops into mind is the humble Samosa.
            These little fried parcels of flaky-yet-tender pastry, stuffed to the brim with spiced potatoes and other ingredients, are pretty much my idea of the world’s greatest savoury snack.
            Not only are they insanely delicious, but they’re also incredibly versatile. Samosas can be served as appetizers, entrees, or a lunch on the move. They’re good hot or at room temperature. They keep for days and days, and they reheat well. What is not to love?</p>

        <h3>Steps -</h3>
        <h4>Part 1: Spiced Potato Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To make this dish, start by roughly mashing boiled potatoes for a textured consistency.</li>
            <li>Next, cook spices, ginger, and chili, and combine them with peas.</li> 
            <li>Add the mashed potatoes, mix well to infuse flavors, and finally, add fresh coriander.</li> 
            <li>Allow the filling to cool before use.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Part 2: Samosa Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the Samosa pastry, first mix flour, Ajwain seeds, and salt, then incorporate ghee until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Add water to form a pliable dough, let it rest for 30 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Divide it into six pieces, shape them into balls, and roll them into 2mm thick discs, each about 16cm (6.5") in diameter.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h4>Part 3: Samosa Parcels</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To assemble the samosas, cut a dough disc in half and brush water along the straight edge.</li>
            <li>Fold one side in to create a cone, fill it with spiced potato filling, brush the cone mouth with water, and seal.</li> 
            <li>Fold the seam side down, trim excess pastry, pinch the top to make it pointy, and fold in the other two corners to finish.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h4>Part 4: Frying</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For frying the samosas, start by sealing the pastry in oil heated to 160°C/320°F for 3 minutes until it's cooked but pale.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels and repeat for the remaining samosas.</li> 
            <li>Then, for the second fry, increase the oil heat to 190°C/375°F and fry the samosas in batches for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes to achieve a golden and crispy pastry.</li>
            <li>Serve them piping hot for the best taste!</li> 
        </ol>
