        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>If you think of an “Indian snack”, probably the first image that pops into mind is the humble Samosa.</p>
        <p>These little fried parcels of flaky-yet-tender pastry, stuffed to the brim with spiced potatoes and other ingredients, are pretty much my idea of the world’s greatest savoury snack. </p>
        <p>Not only are they insanely delicious, but they’re also incredibly versatile. Samosas can be served as appetizers, entrees, or a lunch on the move. They’re good hot or at room temperature. They keep for days and days, and they reheat well. What is not to love?!?</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Boil potatoes until tender, then use a fork to roughly mash. It’s nice to have bits of chunks in the potato for interest, rather than a soft, creamy and uniform mash.</li>
            <li>A healthy dose of spices are fried up with fresh ginger and chilli which is then tossed through along the peas.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed potato and gently but thoroughly mix through, so the flavouring fully permeates the potato.</li>
            <li>Lastly, mix through fresh coriander, then let the filling cool completely before using.</li>
            <li>Mix oil into flour to create the dough. Make sure dough is thoroughly mixed and ready to use!</li>
            <li>Wrap dough around the previously mixed/mashed potatoes. A small handful should be enough to make multiple samosas.</li>
            <li>Lastly, get ready to fry into boiling oil. Fry for about 3/4 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
